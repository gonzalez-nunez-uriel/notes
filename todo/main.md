# Things to write

I am learning a lot about NodeJS. Recently I found out that the module http is an EvenEmitter. This changed completely how I viewed the ecosystem. Node is inherently event driven. Now I realize that all this time I have been working with event without knowing. I am quite ashamed at my ignorance and angry that this was not included in the 'getting started' documentation (or related). Thus, I need to focus on understanding the even-driven mechanisms of Node and learn how to think in this structures. I went as far as reading the Design Overview of libuv; most of it went over my head, but it was still illustrative.

After learning this about NodeJS, I am paying more attention to understanding what frameworks expose, and being aware that it is important to learn the underlying values of a framework and how they are meant to be used. As such, before going deep into Elixir, I want to learn more about BEAM, but I can't find any good source on how the BEAM is constructed - that is, I cannot find the analogous on a libuv within BEAM. I have no idea how its even model works (or even if it has any). I found the docs that explain the servisor-worker paradigm in which is stands, but I am not sure how IO fits in that model, or how to leverage the async message system that they use. That is, I have not found what are the building blocks that BEAM exposes and how they are intended to be used.
