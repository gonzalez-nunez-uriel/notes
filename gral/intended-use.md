# Intended Use

All tools expose a set of primitives that are intended to be used in a specific way. If you ever struggle trying to get something done it is eaither 1) you are using the wrong primitives or 2) you are using them wrong. Take the time to learn the primitives of the tool you are using and the development model behind the tool.
